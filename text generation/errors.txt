These functions will not be directly callable after loading.
WARNINGabslkeras.layers.recurrent.LSTMCell object at 0x000001B8919E95B0 has the same name 'LSTMCell' as a built-in Keras object. Consider renaming class 'keras.layers.recurrent.LSTMCell' to avoid naming conflicts when loading with `tf.keras.models.load_model`. If renaming is not possible, pass the object in the `custom_objects` parameter of the load function.
